			<h1>About  Me</h1>
			<p>I am 17 years of age; I am extremely interested in majority of careers available in the IT sector.
                I am very enthusiastic about all my work; I love the idea of learning on the job as for me it provides a hands-on experience.</p>
			<p>
                From a noticeably early age I have had an interest in all technology for example I have helped my Dad set up networks for small businesses.
                During this I have learnt a vast number of skills, some of these are troubleshooting, rebuilding computers and put the appropriate operating systems on them.
            </p>
			<p>
                This has proved helpful in my everyday life as it has enabled me to help my family and friends with a variety of computer issues. As well as this I have a large interest in designing and
                in becoming a full stack developer too! I have messed around with different coding programmes in my past and enjoyed it thoroughly however I have not made anything big as I
                like to have a plan of what I am building and have reasons to do so.
            </p>
